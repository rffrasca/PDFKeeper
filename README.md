* Set flag state on a selected document and when PDF documents are uploaded to mark for follow-up.
* Add notes to a selected document that can include the date, time, and user account name. All notes can be edited and are indexed by the database.
* Find documents by Search Term, Selections (Author, Subject, Category, and/or Tax Year), or Date Added. In addition, Flagged Documents or All Documents can be listed.
* With PDFKeeper, the following functions can be performed on a selected document: PDF viewing with the bundled or default viewer; PDF bursting; PDF attachments and embedded files extraction; PDF copying to the Clipboard; Flag Document state management; Notes viewing and editing; Keywords, PDF preview, PDF Text, and Search Term Snippets (when applicable) are also displayed for viewing.
* Export selected PDF documents with their category, tax year, notes, and flag state from the database for easy importing.

These features are available in version 10.1.0 and higher.
